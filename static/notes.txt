DESIRED INTERACTIONS
---------------------

- click draw new tile, then click where it goes
- click player tile, then click where it goes (HOME, PORTAL, or NEXT INTERSECTION)
	- if moving to next intersection, this adds resources to player's total
- click portal token (to place on current player location)
- click goal card to collect it, then click on resources (including already-owned goal cards) necessary to buy it

---------------------
STAGES: FINISHED
---------------------

1. draw random road tiles on grid when you click a location
	- goal: build grid in p5js, load sprites from single image, click on tile location to show a random tile
	- example-ish: tiles.js in ~/Sites/tile-placer/tiles.js

2. add resource placement to random tile

3. click to rotate tile
	- clicking empty tile -> choose random tile of three base ones
	- clicking non-empty tile -> rotate tile

4. draw random tile (display it), then choose where it goes
	- new canvas for actions, including "draw tile"
	- when you click "draw tile", a random tile shows up there
	- when you click the random tile, you enter "tile place" mode
	- when in "tile place mode," clicking a tile on main board:
		- if tile is empty, place that tile there
		- if tile is already there, rotate the tile

5. design player tokens that will be visible but not cluttery

6. allow moving player tokens by clicking on it, then clicking its new location

STAGES: NEXT
---------------------

7. Add (compact) counters for four resources, with +/-, and color; also one for VPs
	- [x] layout
	- [ ] render (set colors programmatically)
	- [ ] functionality

8. create GoalCard() object and design
	- [x] render
	- [ ] make top tier goal cards
	- [ ] generate full deck

9. randomly display N GoalCards in control panel

10. allow buying goal cards
	- action: select/highlight goal card by clicking, then click "Buy" button
	- then: goal card disappears and is replaced, resource counters deplete by the appropriate amount, and VP count increases

11. generate an actual deck of tiles (rather than infinites of each type)
	- pre-create all possible Tile()s, and then have their location set to be invisible or whatever
