Pieces:
- map tiles, each marked with one of four resource shields
- goal cards
	- each card with a resource price for buying, and a separate price for trading
		- each card has a 'primary' resource corresponding to whichever resources it requires most of to buy
	- each card has a tier: lower, middle, or top
		- lower and middle tier cards are bought using the # of resources shown on the card
		- the top tier cards are not bought, but are received whenever the player owns the right type of goal cards
	- each card has a VP
		- lower tier VP = # of primary resources
			- e.g., 3 green on a green primary card = 3 VP
		- middle tier = 2*(lower tier VP)
		- top tier = 4 for cards of the same color, 2 for different
- four piles of resource tokens (e.g., from Pandemic)
- player markers
- two portal tokens per player

Game setup:
- place the HOME tile, and both players' markers on the HOME tile
- place five random goal cards face-up for each of three tiers (so 15 cards total) in a designated area ("goal pit" below)
- each player gets two portal tokens
- four piles of resources tokens

Turn:
- draw and place a tile
- now move your player token, choosing one of the following options:
	- to next intersection: move your player token along one of the adjacent paths, stopping at the next intersection
		- you now collect whichever tokens corresponding to the resource shields you passed while moving along the path. two exceptions:
			- if you took this same path (in either direction) on your last turn, you collect zero total tokens
			- if you passed the same shield on your last turn and collected a token for it, you do not collect any tokens on this turn for that same shield
			- note that waiting a turn to move would let you move back along the same path you previously went down and collect the resources again
	- to HOME
		- you do not collect any resources
	- to one of your placed player portals
		- you do not collect any resources
- player may now optionally place one of their portal tokens wherever they currently are on the map
	- you cannot move a portal token once it is placed
- if your player token is currently at HOME, you may buy goal cards
	- to buy a goal card, pay the resource tokens as marked on the goal card, and take the goal card from the "goal pit"
		- you may trade in any number of previously bought goal cards to buy a new goal card, using the number in the bottom righthand corner of each goal card as their credits
		- when cards are traded in they are sent to the discard pile
	- whenever a player is eligible for one of the top-tier cards, they get that card
		- note however that goal cards cannot go towards multiple top-tier cards. e.g., if you have two gold middle-tier cards, and get the  double-gold top-tier card, you cannot use either of those two gold cards to get a different top-tier card

Game ends when either all map tiles are gone, or when all of the top-tier goal cards have been bought.

The player with the most victory points wins.
